# Welcome to my portfolio! 

My name is Ondrej Hoberla and I am a postgraduate psychology student. I graduated from Psychology with Clinical Psychology (International Study) at the University of Lincoln and I am currently finishing a postgraduate programme in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science at the University of Sheffield. I am currently looking for employment opportunities in academia, especially as psychology technician, research assistant, and teaching assistant.

To learn more about me, please feel free to visit my [website](http://hoberla.eu) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ondrej-hoberla/) profile.

### Academic interests

I am particularly interested in applied statistics and data science within psychology research. I enjoy exploring and applying complex solutions to problems related to research methodology, data extraction, or data analysis.

Among my other psychology-related research interests are personality and personality disorders, sexuality and sexual identity, and motivation.

### Work experience

I have rich work experience in a number of fields related to teaching and research.

I have taught and mentored teenagers, young adults, and adults from diverse backgrounds for more than five years now. I have worked with UK as well as international students. My portfolio includes teaching languages and specific language skills (e.g., writing in academic language, referencing work) as well as helping students develop social language through a number of leisure activities. As a member of the National Collaborative Outreach Programme for Lincolnshire, I mentored students from disadvantages backgrounds who were interested in progressing int higher education.

I have further gained research experience while working as a research assistant on an international project organised by the University of Reading which received funding from Horizon Europe. This project was investigating the links between bilingualism and creativity using fMRI data. My work included managing participant data and documentation, scoring participants' responses, computing composite variables, and conducting preliminary data screening and statistical analyses. Moreover, I provided guidance and consultations for a number of postgraduate research projects, e.g., exploring the association between working memory, audio-based time reproduction, and the accuracy of estimating the duration of real-life tasks in individuals in ADHD (respectively).

Fianlly, my administrative and organisational work experience encompasses working as a departmental administrator in a language school, archiving, filing, and quality assurance ambassador in a collaborative outreach project, and a student clearing advisor within the student administration department at the University of Lincoln.

### Learning goals

I am eager to further my skills related to statistics and data science. Along with developing my basic Python programming skills, I would like to explore domains of data science such as using public data in academic research and utilising machine learning in psychology. Within statistics, I am particularly interested in structural modelling and its application in psychometrics (i.e., developing new assessment tools) in social science.

### Career goals

I am currently looking for a role in academia that would allow me to combine my passion for education, psychology, and research methods. I would be thrilled to work in roles like psychology technician, methodology and statistics advisor, or a teaching assistant. I believe that combining my teaching and mentoring experience with my expertise in, and passion for, psychological research will allow me to tailor and deliver support to students who need it as well as develop skill-oriented and student-centred learning content.

## Projects

### [Covid-19 vaccination uptake in the Czech Republic](https://hoberla.github.io/portfolio/dataviz/)

*Data Management and Visualisastion\
Skills employed: R programming, public data extraction, critical appraisal and interpretation\
Area of research: public health, data science*

The aim of this project was to visualise Covid-19 vaccine uptake in the Czech Republic. Completing this project required engaging with the Czech healthcare system, extracting data from public healthcare repositories, cleaning the data and matching it with public statistical reports to provide as accurate region-based estimates as possible. The project site depicts the step-by-step process of creating the visualisation, which is accompanied by a critical appraisal and interpretation.
