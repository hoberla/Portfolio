# About me

## Academic interests
I am particularly interested in applied statistics and data science. I enjoy exploring and applying complex solutions to problems related to research methodology, data extraction, or data analysis.
Among my other psychology-related research interests are personality and personality disorders, sexuality and sexual identity, and motivation.

## Work experience
I have rich work experience in a number of fields related to teaching and research.
I have taught and mentored teenagers, young adults, and adults from diverse backgrounds for more than five years now. I have worked with UK as well as international students. My portfolio includes teaching languages and specific language skills (e.g., writing in academic language, referencing work) as well as helping students develop social language skills through a number of leisure activities. As an ambassador for the National Collaborative Outreach Programme for Lincolnshire, I mentored students from disadvantages backgrounds who were interested in progressing into higher education.
I have further gained research experience while working as a research assistant on an international project organised by the University of Reading which received funding from Horizon Europe. The project was investigating the links between bilingualism and creativity. My work included managing participant data and documentation, scoring participants' responses, computing composite variables, and conducting preliminary data screening and statistical analyses. Moreover, I provided guidance and consultations for a number of postgraduate research projects, e.g., exploring the association between working memory, audio-based time reproduction, and the accuracy of estimating the duration of real-life tasks in individuals in ADHD (respectively).
Finally, my administrative and organisational work experience encompasses working as a departmental administrator in a language school, archiving, filing, and quality assurance ambassador in a collaborative outreach project, and a student clearing advisor within the student administration department at the University of Lincoln.

## Learning goals
I am eager to further develop my skills related to statistics and data science. Along with developing my basic Python programming skills, I would like to explore domains of data science such as using public data in academic research and utilising machine learning in psychology. Within statistics, I am particularly interested in structural modelling and its application in psychometrics (i.e., developing new assessment tools).

## Career goals
I am currently looking for a role in academia that would allow me to combine my passion for education, psychology, and research methods. I would be thrilled to work on positions such as psychology technician, statistics advisor, or a teaching assistant. I believe that combining my teaching and mentoring experience with my expertise in, and passion for, psychological research will allow me to tailor support to individual students' needs as well as develop skill-development-oriented and student-centred learning content.
